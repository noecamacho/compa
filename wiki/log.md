# Wiki log

Append-only. Newest entry at the bottom. Entry format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <operation> | <title>` where operation is `ingest`, `query` or `lint` (see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)).

## [2026-10-28] ingest | COMPA build plan PDF (21 pages)

- Source: `raw/pasillo-plan-de-construccion.pdf`, read in full (text layer plus page images for the diagrams on p. 4, p. 8 and p. 16).
- Created: `sources/build-plan`, `overview`, `users`, `success-metrics`, `mvp-scope`, `connection-flow`, `screens/*` (6 pages plus README), `live-dashboard`, `points-rules`, `topics-vocabulary`, `rounds-and-badges`, `privacy-consent`, `architecture-stack`, `data-model`, `api`, `ai-jobs`, `team-and-prs`, `timeline`, `agent-contract`, `demo-script`, `risks`, `delivery-checklist`, `open-questions`, `glossary`, `index`.
- Naming: the source uses a former product name; the wiki uses COMPA everywhere and records the former name only in the glossary and the source summary.
- Decisions recorded outside the wiki: `ARCHITECTURE.md` (ADR-001 to ADR-009 derived from p. 7–11), `DESIGN.md` (principles from p. 1, p. 6, p. 17).
- Open questions: 18 items logged in `open-questions`, including the plan's own closing-time contradiction (p. 16, p. 20).
- Decision recorded (captain, 2026-10-28 19:30): submission deadline 10:00 on 2026-10-29 for MVP, README and demo video; logged in `timeline` and `open-questions` #1; fast-path rules added to `AGENTS.md`.
- Repository PR template: derived from the plan's template (p. 15) and extended with Jira, wiki impact and standards gates; the plan's "Video / GIF" item became the optional evidence line under "How it was tested".

## [2026-10-28] ingest | Codex Build Day Guadalajara slides (14 slides)

- Source: `raw/build-day-slides/slide-01.png` to `slide-14.png`, read in full from the page images; page and links captured in `sources/build-day-slides`.
- Created: `sources/build-day-slides`, `hackathon-requirements`.
- Updated: `timeline` (event and submission deadlines now sourced), `delivery-checklist` (submission items the plan lacks), `open-questions` (#1 resolved by the deck, #14 extended, #19 added on Codex evidence), `glossary`, `index`.
- Hook change: `raw/README.md` is exempt from the `raw/` immutability check so the source index can grow.
